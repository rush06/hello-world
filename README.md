# C. Why Use Git and Version Control?
i.	I’ve worked with git before at my internship at Ursa Major. They taught us how to use the internal repositories and how version control helps them track their testing. 

ii.	Seeing a formalized definition of version control and its importance is good to read about. I know that it helped the workflow in my experience, but for CS and more adept coders than me, it’s a lifesaver. 

# D. Git from the Command Line
Ran smoothly for setup

# E. Cloning the Tutorial Repo Locally
Cloned the repo with no issues.

# F. Committing Changes from the Command Line
Had to make a token for this to work. Called the token "aste404" and made it valid until class ends. Saved it locally as well.
